## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form.

For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., `# Heading One`). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., `**this text is bold**`). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications. The screenshot below shows a Markdown file.

You can add Markdown formatting elements to a plaintext file using a text editor application. Or you can use one of the many Markdown applications for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android operating systems. There are also several web-based applications specifically designed for writing in Markdown.

Depending on the application you use, you may not be able to preview the formatted document in real time. But that’s okay. According to Gruber, Markdown syntax is designed to be readable and unobtrusive, so the text in Markdown files can be read even if it isn’t rendered.

> The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

## How Does it Work?

When you write in Markdown, the text is stored in a plaintext file that has an .md or .markdown extension. But then what? How is your Markdown-formatted file converted into HTML or a print-ready document?

The short answer is that you need a Markdown application capable of processing the Markdown file. Despite their visual differences, all of the applications do the same thing.

Markdown applications use something called a Markdown processor (also commonly referred to as a “parser” or an “implementation”) to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. At that point, your document can be viewed in a web browser or combined with a style sheet and printed. You can see a visual representation of this process below.

## Why Use Markdown?
- **Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.**  

- **Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application.**  

- **Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application.**  

- **Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.**  

- **Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.**

## Markdown Flavours
One of the most confusing aspects of using Markdown is that practically every Markdown application implements a slightly different version of Markdown. These variants of Markdown are commonly referred to as **flavors**.

 If you start using [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io) to write with Markdown you will realized that is a vastly different experience than using [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app) or [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org). Practically speaking, this means you never know exactly what a company means when they say they support "Markdown." Are they talking about only the basic syntax elements, or all of the basic and extended syntax elements combined, or some arbitrary combination of syntax elements? You won’t know until you read the documentation or start using the application.
 
If you’re just starting out, the best advice I can give you is to pick a Markdown application with good Markdown support. That’ll go a long way towards maintaining the portability of your Markdown files. You might want to store and use your Markdown files in other applications, and to do that you need to start with an application that provides good support. You can use the [tool directory](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/) to find an application that fits the bill.

##  What’s Markdown Good For?
Markdown is a fast and easy way to take notes, create content for a website, and produce print-ready documents.

It doesn’t take long to learn the Markdown syntax, and once you know how to use it, you can write using Markdown just about everywhere. Most people use Markdown to create content for the web, but Markdown is good for formatting everything from email messages to grocery lists.

Here are some examples of what you can do with Markdown.

## Websites
Markdown was designed for the web, so it should come as no surprise that there are plenty of applications specifically designed for creating website content.

If you are still in trouble to pick a specifically apllications, just pick one of the [many other static site generators available.](https://jamstack.org/generators/)

## Documents
Markdown doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of word processors like Microsoft Word, but it’s good enough for creating basic documents like assignments and letters. You can use a Markdown document authoring application to create and export Markdown-formatted documents to PDF or HTML file format. The PDF part is **key**, because once you have a PDF document, you can do anything with it — **print it, email it, or upload it** to a website.

Here are some Markdown document authoring applications recommended:

- **Mac:** [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com), [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), or [Marked 2](https://marked2app.com) 
- **iOS / Android:** [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) 
- **Windows:** [ghostwriter](https://github.com/KDE/ghostwriter)  
- **Linux:** [ReText](https://retext.ai) or [ghostwriter](https://github.com/KDE/ghostwriter) 
- **Web:** [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io)  or [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io) 

## Notes
In nearly every way, Markdown is the ideal syntax for taking notes. **Evernote** and **OneNote**, two of the most popular note applications, don’t currently support Markdown. The good news is that several other note applications do support Markdown:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a popular Markdown note-taking application loaded with features.
- [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com) is a free, barebones note-taking application available for every platform.
- [Notable](https://notable.app) is a note-taking application that runs on a variety of platforms.
- [Bear](https://bear.app) is an Evernote-like application available for Mac and iOS devices. 
- [Boostnote](https://boostnote.io) bills itself as an "open source note-taking app designed for programmers."

## Books
Looking to self-publish a novel? Try [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com), a service that takes your Markdown-formatted files and turns them into an electronic book. Leanpub outputs your book in PDF, EPUB, and MOBI file format. 

## Email
If you send a lot of email and you’re tired of the formatting controls available on most email provider websites, you’ll be happy to learn there’s an easy way to write email messages using Markdown. [Markdown Here](https://markdown-here.com) is a free and open-source browser extension that converts Markdown-formatted text into HTML that’s ready to send.

## Collaboration
Collaboration and team messaging applications are a popular way of communicating with coworkers and friends at work and home. These applications don’t utilize all of Markdown’s features, but the features they do provide are fairly useful. For example, the ability to bold and italicize text without using the WYSIWYG interface is pretty handy. [Discord](https://discord.com), [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki), and [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com) are all good collaboration applications.

## Documentation
Markdown is a natural fit for technical documentation. Companies like GitHub are increasingly switching to Markdown for their documentation. If you write documentation for a product or service, take a look at these handy tools:

- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) is a fast and simple static site generator that’s geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown and configured with a single YAML configuration file. MkDocs has several [built in themes](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/choosing-your-theme/), including a port of the [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org) documentation theme for use with MkDocs.
- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) is an optimized site generator in React. Docusaurus helps you to move fast and write content. Build documentation websites, blogs, marketing pages, and more.
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) transform your plain text into static websites and blogs.
