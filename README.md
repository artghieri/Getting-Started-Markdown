## What is Markdown?
#### Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form.

For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications. The screenshot below shows a Markdown file.

You can add Markdown formatting elements to a plaintext file using a text editor application. Or you can use one of the many Markdown applications for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android operating systems. There are also several web-based applications specifically designed for writing in Markdown.

Depending on the application you use, you may not be able to preview the formatted document in real time. But that’s okay. According to Gruber, Markdown syntax is designed to be readable and unobtrusive, so the text in Markdown files can be read even if it isn’t rendered.

> The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

## Why Use Markdown?
- **Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.**  

- **Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application.**  

- **Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application.**  

- **Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.**  

- **Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.**

## Markdown Flavours
One of the most confusing aspects of using Markdown is that practically every Markdown application implements a slightly different version of Markdown. These variants of Markdown are commonly referred to as **flavors**.

To wrap your head around the concept of Markdown flavors, it might help to think of them as language dialects. People in New York City speak English just like the people in London, but there are substantial differences between the dialects used in both cities. The same is true for people using different Markdown applications. Using [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io) to write with Markdown is a vastly different experience than using [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app) or [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org).

Practically speaking, this means you never know exactly what a company means when they say they support “Markdown.” Are they talking about only the basic syntax elements, or all of the basic and extended syntax elements combined, or some arbitrary combination of syntax elements? You won’t know until you read the documentation or start using the application.

If you’re just starting out, the best advice I can give you is to pick a Markdown application with good Markdown support. That’ll go a long way towards maintaining the portability of your Markdown files. You might want to store and use your Markdown files in other applications, and to do that you need to start with an application that provides good support. You can use the [tool directory](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/) to find an application that fits the bill.

##  What’s Markdown Good For?
Markdown is a fast and easy way to take notes, create content for a website, and produce print-ready documents.

It doesn’t take long to learn the Markdown syntax, and once you know how to use it, you can write using Markdown just about everywhere. Most people use Markdown to create content for the web, but Markdown is good for formatting everything from email messages to grocery lists.

Here are some examples of what you can do with Markdown.

## Documents
Markdown doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of word processors like Microsoft Word, but it’s good enough for creating basic documents like assignments and letters. You can use a Markdown document authoring application to create and export Markdown-formatted documents to PDF or HTML file format. The PDF part is key, because once you have a PDF document, you can do anything with it — print it, email it, or upload it to a website.

Here are some Markdown document authoring applications recommended:

- **Mac:** [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com), [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), or [Marked 2](https://marked2app.com)
- **iOS / Android:** [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)
- **Windows:** [ghostwriter](https://github.com/KDE/ghostwriter) 
- **Linux:** [ReText](https://retext.ai) or [ghostwriter](https://github.com/KDE/ghostwriter)
- **Web:** [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io)  or [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io)
 
## Notes
In nearly every way, Markdown is the ideal syntax for taking notes. Sadly, Evernote and OneNote, two of the most popular note applications, don’t currently support Markdown. The good news is that several other note applications do support Markdown:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a popular Markdown note-taking application loaded with features.
- [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com) is a free, barebones note-taking application available for every platform.
- [Notable](https://notable.app) is a note-taking application that runs on a variety of platforms.
- [Bear](https://bear.app) is an Evernote-like application available for Mac and iOS devices. 
- [Boostnote](https://boostnote.io) bills itself as an "open source note-taking app designed for programmers."
